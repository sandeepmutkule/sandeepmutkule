👋 Hello there! My name is Sandeep Mutkule, and I am a data analyst who is passionate about using technology to generate meaningful insights. I'm currently immersed in data at Findability Sciences, where I specialize in developing advanced EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) solutions and forecasting.

🔍 At Findability Sciences, I've honed my skills in reducing complicated data processes using cutting-edge solutions like the No Code EDA Platform (NCEP). I've optimized EDA processes by integrating Python scripts and using a variety of libraries, allowing our team to focus on extracting valuable insights rather than getting mired down in preprocessing.

📈 I've also improved my forecasting skills by projecting product sales for retail outlets and real estate indicators in different places. I've achieved excellent accuracy using time series algorithms such as ARIMA and Prophet.
