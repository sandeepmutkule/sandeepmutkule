👋 Hey there! I'm Sandeep Mutkule, a data analyst with a passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful insights. Currently, I'm diving deep into data at Findability Sciences, where I specialize in crafting advanced solutions for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and forecasting.

🔍 At Findability Sciences, I've developed a knack for simplifying complex data tasks through innovative tools like the No Code EDA Platform (NCEP). By integrating Python scripts and utilizing a range of libraries, I've streamlined EDA processes, allowing our team to focus on extracting meaningful insights rather than getting bogged down by preprocessing.

📈 Additionally, I've honed my forecasting skills by predicting product sales for retail stores and real estate indicators across diverse regions. Leveraging time series algorithms like ARIMA and Prophet, I've achieved impressive accuracy, empowering businesses to make informed decisions with confidence.

🎓 With a background in Statistics and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills. Let's connect and collaborate on some exciting data projects!
